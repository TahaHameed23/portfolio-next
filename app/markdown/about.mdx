I'm a student pursuing undergraduate degree in computer science, I have experience

with web technologies (full stack), primarily focused on **backend** development.

I enjoy working in the cloud ☁️, and I've developed and managed services and

websites on a variety of cloud platforms.

I also love to work, develop and contribute in open source communities.

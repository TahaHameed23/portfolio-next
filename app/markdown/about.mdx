### My **journey** below of how I became who I am today:

I started exploring things that amazed me around websites, how they work? what's exactly is a server?

In my early days of college, following the academics,I started learning C programming language and whenever I had time I used to explore and save resources which will help me in future (and it's really helping me now).

### **My interests**:
Initially, I had interest in front-end development and designing but as I started exploring Javascript,I got more interested in backend development and started learning Node.js and Express.js.

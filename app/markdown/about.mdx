### My **journey** below of how I became who I am today:

I started exploring things that amazed me around websites, how they work? what's exactly is a server?(I'll come back here)

In my early days of college, following the academics,I started learning C programming language. Whenever I had time, I explored and saved resources for the future—and they’re really paying off now.
<br/>

Initially, I had interest in front-end development and designing(UI/UX) but as I started exploring Javascript, I got more interested in backend development and started learning Node.js and Express.js.
I knew that I wanted to work on backend development, so I started learning about databases (though I had some basics in my school) and how to interact with them. I learned about SQL and NoSQL databases, and how to use them in my projects.
<br/>

One thing that always intrigued me was how to manage projects on github, the first PR I made was in a social community project called milan, though it was a UI fix, I got the experience of creating a issue and then a PR.
My second and third year were the years where I concentrated more on projects. Got my hands dirty with React, learnt more about API development and testing, and also started learning about cloud solutions.
